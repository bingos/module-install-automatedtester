NAME
    Module::Install::AutomatedTester - A Module::Install extension to detect
    whether we are being tested by CPAN Testers.

SYNOPSIS
      # In Makefile.PL

      use inc::Module::Install;
      if ( auto_tester ) {
         # Do something if we are running under a CPAN Tester
         # like add some prereqs, etc.
      }

DESCRIPTION
    CPAN Testers are great and do a worthy and thankless job, testing all
    the distributions uploaded to CPAN. Sometimes we want to know if our
    distribution is being tested by one of these gallant individuals and
    make them do some extra work.

    Module::Install::AutomatedTesters is a Module::Install extension that
    adds two extra commands to detect if the disttribution is being run
    under a CPAN Tester environment so that we can do extra stuff or skip
    stuff.

COMMANDS
    This plugin adds the following Module::Install command:

    "auto_tester"
        Does nothing on the author-side. On the user side it detects whether
        or not automated testing is in effect.

    "cpan_tester"
        Same as the above.
